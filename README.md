## Manual Setup

### Step 1 : Fork or Clone repository

First fork this [Portfolio](https://github.com/Shreyaan-Vashishtha/portfolio-template/) template.

### Step 2 : Add your repository in Forestry

Go to your [forestry](https://forestry.io) account and click on `import your site now`. declare your config.toml file [`exampleSite`] and fill up basic settings .

Now mark everything as done, then go to configuration to change the base url . You can put any url but this have to similar as Netlify . So for now put a name which you are going to put in Netlify as a Netlify subdomain (E.g. your-domain-here.netlify.app).

### Step 3 : Setup and host website with Netlify

Here comes the last step . Go to your [Netlify](https://netlify.com) account and click add new site . Choose your git repository to import your website in Netlify .  And now you can see the forked `Portfolio` theme. select it and follow the steps. Then go to `Site Settings` for change the site name and put your subdomain name here what you put on forestry as base url. save it and go to `Deploy` from top menu, Wait a while and click on `Site Preview` or just simply go to the subdomain you put as base url. 

**BOOM! Your site is live.** 

Now you can go to forestry and add, remove or customize every setting and content.
